V1.1.1

AroAI - Lord Aro's feeble attempt at making an AI. Currently buses only.

NOTE: This AI uses the 1.1 version of the API and due to recent changes in it,
	you now need OpenTTD r20563 or later for this AI to work properly

All code is released under GPL v2, as I have nicked a lot of code from others whose license is 
also GPL v2! 
N.B. I have no problem with releasing it as GPL v2 anyway!

Special thanks go to (in no particular order):
	* Those who helped me out:
		- Yexo;
		- Michiel;
		- planetmaker;
		- Morloth;
		- Dezmond_snz;
		- Steffl;
		- Dustin (if it were not for him, I might have 
				given up trying to make an AI altogether!);
		- Kogut;
		- Yexo (again, because he helped me so much);
		
	* Those who I nicked bits of their AI from:
		- Maninthebox - OTVI, Rondje om de Kerk;
		- Team Rocket - RocketAI;
		
	* Those who I nicked bits of their AI AND they helped me out:
		- Xander - JAMI;
		- fanioz - Trans;
		- Brumi - SimpleAI;
		- Zuu - SuperLib;
		
	* orudge - for his wonderful forums;
	* anybody else I've missed (please say if I have);
	* and finally, just to be cheesy, all the OpenTTD developers for making this wonderful game!
